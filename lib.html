        Book is a general term that can refer to many works such as dictionary, encyclopedia, atlas, textbook, anthology of short stories, poems, etc. Novel, on the other hand, refers to a fictitious prose narrative. The main difference between book and novel is that book can be fiction or nonfiction whereas a novel is always a fiction.
